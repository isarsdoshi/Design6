# CPE 322-A, Engineering Design VI
## Semester: *Spring 2023*
### Introduction
Hi, I am Isar Doshi. I am currently a junior at Stevens Institute of Technology with a major in computer engineering and a minor in economics. I plan on attending graduate school for financial engineering. My long term goal is to combine my passions for finance and technology and pursue a career in quantitative finance.

### Experiences
Aside from my experiences in school, I also have a plethora of experiences outside of school. To start off, I have internship experience in both software engineering and product management in various industries. A couple of industries that I have a lot of experience working in are biotechnology and financial technology. This upcoming summer, I will be interning at JP Morgan, where I will be applying both my financial skills and technological skills.

LAB 1:

To start this lab, I initially downloaded GHDL and GTKWave.

Next, I cloned the 'dsd' repository, and then made and changed the directory to a new 'vhdl' directory. After that, I copied the VHDL code to the current directory.

![E322 Lab 1 Pic 10](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/62fa001c-43c4-4b20-9252-ad08ee68adcb)

Following that, I experimented with GHDL by printing out "Hello World." After successfully running "Hello World," I ended up experimenting with running both Half Adder and Full Adder. While the lab only required us to experiment with Half Adder, I ended up running Full Adder as well to better understand GHDL.

![E322 Lab 1 Pic 12](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/4875b21c-1699-4d56-af9e-9a386cf94119)

Finally, I extended my knowledge and skills within GHDL by running D Flip-flop.

LAB 2: 

For this lab, I had to experiment with the command line, which helped me develop a better understanding of commands in Linux. To start off, "hostname" essentially provided the host name portion of the full name of the computer. Next, "env" listed all the environment variables. After that, the "ps" command permitted me to check the status of active processes on the system. Following that, the "pwd" command wrote the full name of the current direction. Next, "git clone" cloned the contents of the Github repo onto the system. Furthermore, "cd" changed the directory and "ls" listed the files of the directory. In addition, "df" showed the amount of free diskspace on the server. After that, "mkdir demo" made a new file in the directory named "demo". Thus, "cd demo" changed the directory to "demo". Then, "nanofile" opened the file in the text-based editor Nano. Now, "cat file" helped read each parameter and put it in the output of the terminal. After that, the "cp", "mv", and "rv" commands essentially helped copy files, move files, and remove a file. Obviously, "clear" helped clear the terminal. Moreover, "man uname" helped output information about the Operating System, the system host name, or hardware to the standard output. Similarly, "uname -a" printed the kernel name, release, and version; the network node hostname; the machine hardware name; the processor type; the hardware platform; and the operating system. After that, the "ifconfig" command showed all of the current TCP/IP network configuration values. Now, the "ping localhost" command pinged the local IP address. Finally, "netstat" provided statistics about all active connections.

LAB 3:

This lab first required me to install certain Python packages, such as jdcal, astral, and geopy. Following that, various commands from the Python package were run. These commands helped me learn about the packages that Python offers, and how beneficial they are. For example, I was able to find some interesting information like the date, time, and coordinates of the "SC Williams Library" from the commands.

LAB 4:

To start this lab, I first installed Django and Django REST framework.

![E322 Lab 4 Pic 1](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/7d70502d-2f44-44c8-9b53-36c7f3697136)

For the next part of the lab, I attempted to use the default database, SQLite. I also attempted to start the Django project "stevens", as well as the Django REST project "mycpu". I was able to successfully carry out parts of these processes, but not all of them due to technical difficulties with my computer. However, it is evident I persisted. The pictures below show one of my attempts at starting the Django project "stevens", running the server, and viewing the application.Â

LAB 5:

To start off this lab, I first installed Paho-MQTT. After this installation, I changed the directory to the iot repository and then updated the repository with git pull. After updating the repository, I ended up changing the directory to Lesson 5.

![E322 Lab 5 - Pic 1](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/e102d7a7-bd53-44b5-9865-2630cfe5ee83)

Finally, I was able to complete the lab on two terminals. I ran python3 subcpu.py on one terminal and ran python3 pubcpu.py on another terminal.

LAB 6:

Like the last lab, this one was also not very complex. To start this lab, I had several things to install. With that being said, I first installed Node.js and ran hello-world.js. Following that, I installed hello.js and http.js. Following the installations, I refreshed the webpage to observe the server activities. 

![E322 Lab 6 - Pic 1](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/bc20b447-910d-4695-90ec-94043c49dd1c)

For the next part of the lab, I installed Pystache. Following the installation, I ran say_hello.py that used the template in say_hello.mustache.

LAB 7:

To start this lab, I first signed up for a MathWorks ThingSpeak account. After making this account, I logged into it. Following that, I ran thingspeak_cpu_loop.py or thinkspeak_feed.py in a demo folder. 

![E322 Lab 7 Pic 1](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/046898fa-8e8e-4e62-a37d-e56d5774c0ec)

Next, I installed gspread and oauth2client. After that, I logged in to the Google Cloud Platform Identity and Access Management, created a project called cpudata, enabled both Drive API and Sheets API, and then created and downloaded the service account JSON key file. Following that, I started a new Google Sheet called cpudata and shared it with the client email in the JSON file. Finally, I attempted to run cpu_spreadsheet.py with the JSON key file in a demo folder. However, due to technological issues with my laptop, I was unable to successfully carry out this part of the project. I did persist and try several times, but was unable to carry it out completely due to technological issues.

LAB 8:

This lab was focused on data analysis. To start off, I installed certain Python packages, as these packages helped carry out data analysis techniques.

![E322 Lab 8 Pic 1](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/c0f5fa2f-e70b-48b3-89c7-1e8b113c3119)

After that, I started experimenting with the X applications. I ran through each of them and was able to see the interesting features they all offered. Following that, I experimented with the Numpy array and was able to successfully execute each of the commands. However, for every task after that, such as plotting the data from Lab 7, I was unable to successfully carry it out due to technological issues with my laptop. I persisted and tried several times, but the technological issues made it arduous to overcome the obstacles.

LAB 9:

I started off this lab by first installing two things. With that being said, I installed pyang and PlantUML. After that, I copied ~/iot/lesson9/intrusiondetection.yang to ~/demo.


![E322 Lab 9 - Pic 1](https://github.com/isarsdoshi/Design6/assets/98429892/65be6780-b4f5-40ab-abc2-5ac388bc7908)

Next, I attempted to run pyang to generate intrusiondetection.yin and intrusiondetection.uml. I also attempted to run PlantUML to generate intrusiondetection.png. However, due to technological issues with my laptop, I was unable to successfully carry out this operation despite trying several times.

LAB 10: 

For this lab, I first started off by running hash_value.py twice and comparing the results. Next, I ran snakecoin.py. Following that, I ran snakecoin-server-full-code.py on Terminal 1 and mined a new block on Terminal 2. After that, I cloned the Python blockchain app and uncommented the last line of node_server.py. Finally, I attempted to run node_server.py on Terminal 1 and run_app.py on Terminal 2. However, due to technological issues with my laptop, I was unable to successfully carry out this operation despite trying several times.
