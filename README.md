LAB 1:

To start this lab, I initially downloaded GHDL and GTKWave.

Next, I cloned the 'dsd' repository, made and changed the directory to a new 'vhdl' directory. After that, I copied the VHDL code to the current directory.

Following that, I experimented with GHDL by printing out "Hello World." After successfully running "Hello World," I ended up experimenting with running both Half Adder and Full Adder. While the lab only required us to experiment with Half Adder, I ended up running Full Adder as well to better understand GHDL.

Finally, I extended my knowledge and skills within GHDL by running D Flip-flop.

LAB 2: 

For this lab, I had to experiment with the command line, which helped me develop a better understanding of commands in Linux. To start off, "hostname" essentially provided the host name portion of the full name of the computer. Next, "env" listed all the enviornment variables. After that, the "ps" command permitted me to check the status of active processes on the system. Following that, the "pwd" command wrote the full name of the current direction. Next, "git clone" cloned the contents of the Github repo onto the system. Furthermore, "cd" changed the directory and "ls" listed the files of the directory. In addition, "df" showed the amount of free diskspace on the server. After that, "mkdir demo" made a new file in the directory named "demo". Thus, "cd demo" changed the directory to "demo". Then, "nanofile" opened the file in the text-based editor Nano. Now, "cat file" helped read each parameter and put it in the output of the terminal. After that, the "cp", "mv", and "rv" commands essenially helped copy files, move files, and remove a file. Obviously, "clear" helped clear the terminal. Moreover, "man uname" helped output information about the Operating System, the system host name, or hardware to the standard output. Similarly, "uname -a" printed the kernel name, release, and version; the network node hostname; the machine hardware name; the processor type; the hardware platform; and the operating system. After that, the "ifconfig" command showed all of the current TCP/IP network configuration values. Now, the "ping localhost" command pinged the local IP address. Finally, "netstat" provided statistics about all active connections.
